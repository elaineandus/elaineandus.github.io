While my contribution was limited to a specific area, I am proud of the work that our team accomplished together. I was involved in several aspects of the project, such as writing code for specific components, documentation, debugging and testing, and collaborating with the rest of the team. It was a collaborative effort that involved multiple skill sets and an incredible learning experience.
